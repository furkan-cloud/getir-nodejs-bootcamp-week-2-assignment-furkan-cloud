HTTP and FS modules used in project.
Created http server with http module and log the requests and request time to json file.

Server is working on Port: 4000

http://localhost:4000<br>
http://localhost:4000/about<br>
http://localhost:4000/contact<br>
http://localhost:4000/projects<br>

These addresses can be use for valid requests. Other requests will respond as 404.

You don't need to install any dependencies as I used nodejs core modules for this project.

Just clone the repository, run it with "node index" command and enjoy.

You can also read my article about creating web server with HTTP and FS modules with NodeJs from the link below.
