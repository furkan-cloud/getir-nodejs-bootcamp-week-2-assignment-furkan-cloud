HTTP and FS modules used in project.
Created http server with http module and log the requests and request time to json file.

Server is working on Port: 4000

http://localhost:4000
http://localhost:4000/about
http://localhost:4000/contact
http://localhost:4000/projects

These addresses can be use for valid requests. Other requests will respond as 404.

You don't need to install any dependencies as I used nodejs core modules for this project.

Just clone the repository, run it with "node index" command and enjoy.
